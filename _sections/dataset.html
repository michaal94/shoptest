<p style="font-size: 110%; text-align: justify">SHOP-VRB (Simple Household Object Properties) provides a benchmark for visual reasoning and recovering structured, semantic representation of a scene. Our dataset builds on CLEVR benchmark, which contains synthetically generated images and questions related to simple geometrical objects as well as their composition in clear background.
 SHOP-VRB provides scenes with various kitchen objects and appliances, including articulated ones, along with questions associated with those scenes. Each class of objects is provided with a set of short natural language descriptions expanding dataset with visual-textual questions. Apart from classical split into <i style="font-weight: 900">training</i>, <i style="font-weight: 900">validation</i> and <i style="font-weight: 900">test</i>, we suggest another split - <i style="font-weight: 900">benchmark</i> containing unseen objects of known classes as the measure of generalisability.
